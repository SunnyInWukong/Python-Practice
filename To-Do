# to-do :
# Array work
# tree traversal
# depth of a node
# height of a tree
# trie
# adjacent list /adjacent matrix
# Key value binary tree
# searching through numeric binary search trees & non-numeric ones to find specified nodes
# red/black binary tree
# printing out binary trees wih queues
# printing binary trees recursively ( in different orders)
# practice methods for using the "parent" pointer in a tree node class to find common ancestors and such
# hash tables
# priority queue : basically have another element for priority in the node to sort the queue by
# look into cuda cones for ML, parallel processing, and the linear algebra behind the node tuning for ML
#Quicksort algortithm
